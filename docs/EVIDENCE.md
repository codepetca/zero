# Delivery evidence index

This small tracked index survives a fresh checkout. Full logs, screenshots,
archives and caches stay ignored. AI source reviews below are independent local
code reviews, not authenticated GitHub human approvals.

## Independent source review coverage

Unchanged implementation coverage was reused from the integration/media/alternatives
reviews recorded in [historical verification](history/verification-through-2026-10-10.md).
Publication ledger:6launch attempts,5successful review turns,1initial wave,
3targeted waves,1integration wave,2fix batches. One unavailable model request
fell back once to supported GPT-6-Luna. Effective configurations and attributable
tokens are unknown; account weekly allowance25%to24%does not measure task cost.

## Verification and limits

144extension/kit tests,24site tests/types/build; Linux native examples under Xvfb
and a PulseAudio null sink; two reproducible Community builds,6JavaFX checks and
4actual consumers. Synthetic macOS actions and virtual Linux CI do not establish
physical classroom behaviour. Windows/Linux editor/setup, physical typing/choosers,
audible output, school restrictions and novice trials remain unverified.
No live AI provider or independent public Community acceptance is claimed.

Full local receipts: ignored `.verification/publication-2026-10-10/receipt.json`
and `DELIVERY.md`. Their absence on a fresh checkout does not erase this index.
CI artifact retention is14days; public releases/manifests remain the durable
artifact references. Never infer a still-valid authorization from old evidence.

## AI workflow audit and remediation

Audit at Zero `f8f78290` / Community `f6460f48`:43release tests and48Community
boundary tests passed. Reproduced no-op workflow trust, mismatched outbound-byte
budget, and boolean schema acceptance. Remediation passes39admission and25acceptance/release regression tests. Zero
43release tests,24site tests, types/build and configuration/link checks pass. Source
remains local after completed independent review; no new release or live provider.

## GitHub main protection — 2026-10-10

Owner authorized enforcement after the audit. Authenticated API readback confirms
1current human approval, stale-approval dismissal and latest-push approval by
another human, strict up-to-date GitHub Actions `review` from app15368,
resolved conversations, admin enforcement and no review bypass/force push/deletion.
The settings snapshot is [main-protection.json](../.github/main-protection.json).
Named [CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS) is local until its human-reviewed merge.
Readback JSON is retained locally in Zero .verification/ai-flow-hardening-2026-10-10.
Initial API request was rejected422 with both contexts/checks; corrected checks-only
request applied successfully. No account identity, credentials or release bytes changed.

## Independent remediation review — initial wave

`ai_hardening_security_review/turn1` (correctness) reviewed Community `f6460f48..a120d2cb` and Zero rules at
`49385146`; `ai_hardening_compat_review/turn1` reviewed both complete `f8f78290..49385146` and
`f6460f48..a120d2cb` diffs. Requested GPT-6.1-Sol/high in two fresh contexts;
effective configuration/tokens/elapsed telemetry unknown. Both assigned scopes
complete. Accepted two P2 corrections: final PR/review/role readback and accurate
publisher stop/resume documentation. First correction batch passes25acceptance
regressions (15.202seconds), retaining39admission tests and unchanged source digest.
Targeted independent review completed for both correction deltas. Main protection
was absent (authenticated404 `Branch not protected`, repository rulesets empty)
before applying the stronger gate; the apply script rechecked that baseline.

## Accepted local hardening delivery

`ai_hardening_security_review/turn2` covered Community `a120d2cb..6be28609fae074b1e0d8b51d142b8e1c5a4b842b`
and Zero `49385146..1d37a70276843a695a5a83fc0ebdbf5cbf92d79b`, requested
GPT-6.1-Sol/high. Complete correction scope, both accepted P2 findings resolved,
no new blockers; five focused race cases passed in2.173seconds. Initial unchanged
policy/AI and compatibility coverage remains applicable; no extra integration wave.

Final checks:39admission,25acceptance/release,43Zero release and24site tests pass;
Zero configuration/links/types/production build pass. Current CLI emits33,875UTF-8
request bytes, no provider call; library source digest unchanged. GitHub protection
was read back again after review, matching the intended gate. Histories match the
original revisions except archive headers/rebased links. Primary funding work untouched.

Review ledger:2initial turns+1targeted turn,1fix batch,0failed reviewer launches;
effective models/attributable tokens/worker elapsed telemetry unknown. Conservative
review budget clock01:06:06–01:12:04UTC (~6minutes), not measured worker/coordination
cost. Implementation worker estimated12minutes+4minutes correction; those estimates
are not a claim of savings. No source push/PR/merge, new release or live AI provider.
Final receipt-only state edits are coordinator-checked; runtime source is unchanged
from the reviewed revisions. Code-owner file selection takes effect after human merge.
